# Laundry
My django app
so this app i made for my laundry dorm this is pretty simple and the design also not really good but i focus in the backend and i still need to update also
so basicly the process of this app is :
there are 3 user : - user
                   - admin
                   - superuser
 so user can login as a student or those who give their clothes to the laundry dorm and after that the admin of the laundry will ask them the infortmation of 
 their clothes ,is like, how much clothes that they give,when they give, after that the admin of the laundry will input the data and give the status to the user
 that their clothes still washing or finish.and that information also can be looked by the user those who give the clothes so they know when to take the clothes 
 without afraid that their clothes still washing or no. if their clothes finish the admin will change the status that their clothes is done or finish so they can 
 see the information from their account user and they take their clothes. actually the system is the same with my dormitory but the differennce is 
 the app can be accessed online no need to write down the data that they use before. but this app still need update for the new feature
